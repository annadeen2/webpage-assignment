      <p>Margaret Hook, 93, is known as "Marge” to friends, and as “Margie” to her niece. She lives in a ranch-style house with siding the color of buttermilk. The house is situated on several acres of land that an occasional black bear has been
        known
        to roam through. A garden plot, which her husband, Joseph “Joe” Hook, once cultivated with brussel sprouts, has been left fallow.</p>

      <p>Today, she sits on her porch in a white lawn chair, flicking ladybugs away from the upright beams, and nudging brown leaves off the edge of her porch with her cane.</p>

      <p>In her lifetime, Hook has worn many hats, having worked as an editorial assistant, travel writer, and civil servant. She used to volunteer as a poll worker in the town of Bethany. Despite considering herself a Democrat, she says that she
        registered as a Republican, so that her application to work as a poll worker wouldn’t be turned away by the political party in power.</p>

      <p>Bethany is next door to Honesdale, is the county seat of Wayne County in the Northeastern corner of Pennsylvania. Honesdale is a town that boasts the sole editorial office of <i>Highlights for Children</i> and eight churches for a
        population
        of 4,480. Along Main Street—which is home to an Eastern European grocery, boutiques, the police department, a firearms store, and several restaurants—the Wayne County Republican and Democratic Parties have set up shop in vacant storefronts,
        as
        they attempt to drum up support for their respective candidates.</p>

    <div class="container">
      <p>In a battleground state like Pennsylvania, the residents are passionate. Nearly every yard has a political sign. Though most signs are in favor of re-electing Donald Trump, a fair few show support for Joseph Biden.</p>

      <p>Even though Hook hasn’t left her house due to COVID-19 in months, she plans on voting. “I think they’ll send someone out to pick me up,” she says. When asked if she plans on voting early, she waves her hand. She says she’ll figure it out.
